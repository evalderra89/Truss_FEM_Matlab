# Truss_FEM_Matlab
This code calculates the displacements and stresses in a truss 2D, using the finite element method.

To use this code, you need to create a folder called <<inputs>> and save the input files on it. You should modify the main function truss2D.m in the line 12 by typing the name of your input file. The Truss_FEM_Matlab folder contains nine examples of input files (from problem1.txt to problem9.txt). More information about the format of the input files is located in the function readFiles.m.
